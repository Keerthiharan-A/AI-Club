Task-1:
Implemented a RNN model from scratch for Sunspot time series prediction.
Read the "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" research paper published by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton and Summarised it.
Task-2:
Utilized the GPT-2 model from Hugging face to generate a pipeline and generate text from it, also used CLIP to generate captions for the given image.
Built transformer models using BERT and T5 and fine-tuned for Fake news detection and compared their performances and prediction accuracy.
Understood the working and architecture of transformers, read the research paper "Attention is all you need!" and Summarised it.
