**Task-1:** <br />
<ul>
<li> Implemented a RNN model from scratch for Sunspot time series prediction. </li>
<li> Read the "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" research paper published by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton and Summarised it. </li> <br />
</ul>
**Task-2:** <br />
<ul>
<li> Utilized the GPT-2 model from Hugging face to generate a pipeline and generate text from it, also used CLIP to generate captions for the given image. </li>
<li> Built transformer models using BERT and T5 and fine-tuned for Fake news detection and compared their performances and prediction accuracy. </li>
<li> Understood the working and architecture of transformers, read the research paper "Attention is all you need!" and Summarised it. </li>
</ul>
